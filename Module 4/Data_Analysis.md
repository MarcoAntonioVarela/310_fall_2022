## Overview
Welcome! I will work on data analysis project, by exploring  the "Housing Price" dataset (provided by https://towardsdatascience.com/), [click here to learn more about this data set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rashida048/Datasets/master/home_data.csv)

<img src="../Images/housing.jpg" height="250" weight = "150" /> 

The structure (columns) of this dataset is the following:
id, date, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living, sqft_lot, floors, waterfront, view, condition, grade, sqft_above, sqft_basement, yr_built, yr_renovated, zip code, lat, long, sqft_living15, sqft_lot15.


While analyzing this data set, I will focus on answering important questions (I will show them with the code I used to answer them at the bottom of this document)


I installed and used 2 Python libraries to analyze this data set:
* Pandas (Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.)
* Altair (Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python. It provides several features to perform data analysis while creating stunning visualizations)

To install this two Python libraries on my computer I needed to run this code in my terminal:

```
pip install altair
pip install pandas
```



This is how my dataset looks like:

## Future Work

* I would like to learn how to group by specific categories using pandas
* I would like to learn how to use other charts, line a line graph, bar chart, pie chart
* I would like to know how to wrangle and clean my data better (I had problems with the date column because it was a string rather than a date datatype)
