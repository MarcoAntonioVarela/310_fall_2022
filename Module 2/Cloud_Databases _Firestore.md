## Overview
Welcome to my <b>Cloud Databases</b> project!\
During this project I will be using the new version of Firebase 9 to create a database for my Mexican Restaurant!\
Firebase is what is know as a back end as a service, it provides back-end services like databases, authentication, file storage, cloud functions, hosting and other services as well that we can plug directly into our front-end applications or websites to make use of them.

During this project, I learned that the differences between the last version of Firebase (8) and Firebase 9 are that this new version adopts a more modular and functional approach, meaning that we only import the firebase functions that we need from the libraries and not those we do not need, in contrast, version 8 used a more object oriented approach (calling those functions on methods directly on Firebase objects).

### Getting started!

The first thing I needed to do for this project was to set up a module bundler like webpack in order to use the new firebase version.
I also needed to install node.js on my computer
